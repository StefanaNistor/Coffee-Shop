  about our first <span class="bolded1">struggles</span>, our first <span class="bolded1">sucess</span> and what we've come <span class="bolded1">to be</span> now. Make yourself <span class="bolded1">comfortable</span>, I'll bring you some <span class="bolded1">snacks</span>- sweet or savory, whatever your liking is,

          <h1>The Great Idea </h1>
          <p> It all started one <span class="bolded1">sunny morning</span> whilst drinking a freshly brewed cup of coffee. A normal day, a normal week, a <span class="bolded1">normal life</span>.
            I've always <span class="bolded1">loved</span> coffee, ever since I first took my first sip. I saw it for the <span class="bolded1">art</span> that it was and always respected those who mastered it well- but how does one <span class="bolded1">actually master</span> such an art?
            Slowly, but surely I started <span class="bolded1">investing</span> into gaining knowledge about the craft of <span class="bolded1">coffee making</span>, and slowly I devled into other <span class="bolded1">fun beverages</span>. Friends appreciated it, family loved it and strangers were in awe.
            I realized I wanted to share my craft with the <span class="bolded1">world</span> not only so that I could find fellow coffee lovers, but also to create a <span class="bolded1">safe space</span> for people to come in and relax away from the problems of <span class="bolded1">reality</span>. 
            This was, I realized then, what I was <span class="bolded1">meant to do</span>.

              <h1>Bringing It To Life</h1>
              <p> To bring this idea to <span class="bolded1">life</span> I started hunting for a place to rent out. I wanted the <span class="bolded1">location</span> to be in an easily acessible spot and to be very <span class="bolded1">beautiful.</span>
                Then, I started <span class="bolded1">investing</span> into the best equipment I could find on the market to get the best <span class="bolded1">results</span>. I also invested in an <span class="bolded1">accountant</span> and a <span class="bolded1">marketing specialist</span> to help me get my bearings together.
                Afterwards, thing slowly started to <span class="bolded1">settle in</span>, the equipment was arriving, the <span class="bolded1">raw materials</span> were ordered and soon to be coming, the places was slowly being <span class="bolded1">decorated</span> tastefuly- but low and behold came my first <span class="bolded1"> failiure.</span>
                One pipe broke whilst I was away and <span class="bolded1">flooded</span> my entire rented out space leading to <span class="bolded1">diasaster</span>. It took an extra <span class="bolded1">month</span> to regroup but I was invested into doing this! I knew it would be <span class="bolded1">worth it!</span>

            <h1>Finding The Team </h1>
            <p> After finishing setting up the <span class="bolded1">space</span> I started to look for equally passionate people to help me on my mission. First, I wanted to obtain a <span class="bolded1">contract </span> with a cake shop to obtain the freshest sweets. I also had the same approach for the  <span class="bolded1">savory treats.</span> 
              Here I had the help of a friend's mother who was a passionate <span class="bolded1">retired cook</span> that still wanted to be working, and as such I <span class="bolded1">hired her.</span> Then, for serving personnel I made sure to <span class="bolded1">choose</span> only the best qualified people to ensure <span class="bolded1">the best</span> services when it comes to serving the beverages.
              Slowly, <span class="bolded1">the team took shape</span> and faster than I could blink, the business was <span class="bolded1">up and running!</span> Finally, <span class="bolded1">sucess!</span>

              <h1>Slowly Blooming </h1>
              <p> Through <span class="bolded1">hard work</span> and continuous <span class="bolded1">self improvement</span>, our business slowly grew.
                We were very open to <span class="bolded1">constructive criticism</span> and tried out best to have a very <span class="bolded1">customer friendly </span> approach overall. 
                We tried to have our menus be <span class="bolded1">interactive and fun </span> and to offer our customers the <span class="bolded1">respite </span> that they needed from the world, with the choice of <span class="bolded1">fun minigames </span> to receive discounts for their drinks. 
                With lots of <span class="bolded1">love</span> and <span class="bolded1">care </span> we slowly started <span class="bolded1">blooming</span> and now we can say we are a true well-known <span class="bolded1">brand</span> that vows to offer you the best experience when it comes to consuming <span class="bolded1">anything </span> from our little shop.
                We welcome <span class="bolded1">all </span> with open arms and wish you the <span class="bolded1">best </span> of stays!
