# Coffee-Shop
I created a site for a Coffee Shop using HTML and CSS containing a main page, an about section, a menu and a orders' page which all feature complete responsiveness, a user friendly aspect and for easy navigation a fixed navigation bar. 
The front end of the site has been completed whilst the back end is still a WIP.
