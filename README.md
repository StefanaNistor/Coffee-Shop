# Coffee-Shop Presentation Website

## Overview:
I developed a responsive website for a coffee shop using HTML and CSS, featuring a main page, an about section, a menu, and an orders page. The design ensures full responsiveness, providing a user-friendly experience across all devices. To enhance navigation, the site includes a fixed navigation bar for easy access to different sections. The website delivers complete front-end functionality and is designed to easily integrate with potential backend capabilities for future development.
